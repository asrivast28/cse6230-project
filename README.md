GraphWorks
==========

This project is based on **TreeWorks** project which was implemented by
Abhinav Sarje and Srinivas Aluru as part of their paper titled
"*A MapReduce Style Framework for Computations on Trees*".

TreeWorks implemented a generic framework for parallel computations on trees.
Imaginatively named **GraphWorks** aims to extend the framework for, you guessed it, graphs.

This was primarily being done as part of CSE6230 course project. The final report for the work can be found [here](final-report.pdf).
